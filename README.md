The project involved building a web app that takes user location input (Latitude & Longitude), fetches the Current Weather & Air Pollution data from OpenWeatherMap API and displays the output information with the help of a web (map). It was made using web-dev tools like HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (Leaflet.js library), for fetching data via an API, querying it, and displaying the output as a web (map) app.

This Geospatial_Workflow_Project Repository contains three files:

    HTML&CSSCode.txt - which contains all the HTML web page and CSS web page style formatting.
    JavaScriptCode.txt - which contains the script for fetching, querying, and displaying the result using the Leaflet.js library.
    WebAppFinal.html - which is the actual web app that was made in this project.

    If anyone wishes to use this code can utilize the first two '.txt' files. They can copy the JavaScript content to the HTML&CSS file under the <script> element, and run it using VS Code or in other environments.
    If anyone wishes to run or check the web app, they can simply run the '.html' file and can check the Weather & Air Pollution in their area
